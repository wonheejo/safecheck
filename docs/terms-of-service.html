    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>SafeCheck is a personal safety monitoring application that tracks your check-in activity and alerts your designated trusted contacts via SMS if you fail to check in within your configured time window. The service is intended to provide an additional layer of personal safety and peace of mind.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use SafeCheck. By creating an account, you represent that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these terms.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your account credentials secure</li>
        <li>Provide accurate contact information for your trusted contacts</li>
        <li>Obtain consent from your trusted contacts before adding their phone numbers</li>
        <li>Check in regularly according to your configured schedule</li>
        <li>Keep push notifications enabled for the app to function properly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. SMS Consent &amp; Messaging</h2>
    <p>By using SafeCheck, you authorize the service to send SMS messages to your trusted contacts on your behalf when an inactivity alert is triggered. These messages will identify you by name and inform your contacts that you have not checked in. Standard messaging rates may apply to your trusted contacts. You are responsible for informing your contacts that they may receive these messages.</p>

    <h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>SafeCheck requires push notification permissions to send you check-in reminders and inactivity warnings. Disabling push notifications may prevent the service from functioning as intended. SafeCheck is not liable for missed alerts due to disabled notifications.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitations of Service</h2>
    <p>SafeCheck is not an emergency service and should not be used as a substitute for calling emergency services (e.g., 911, 112, 119). The service depends on internet connectivity, push notification delivery, and third-party SMS providers. We do not guarantee that alerts will be delivered in all circumstances.</p>
    <p>SafeCheck is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, SafeCheck and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your use of the service.</p>

    <h2>8. Account Termination</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through the app settings. Upon deletion, your personal data and trusted contact information will be removed from our systems. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or engage in abusive behavior.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app. Your continued use of SafeCheck after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wonheejo@gmail.com">wonheejo@gmail.com</a>.</p>
